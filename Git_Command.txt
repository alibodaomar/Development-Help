$ git pull origin test_d0                    //git all changes from test_d0  
$ git checkout -b feature/bills_dz test_d0   //Create branch bills_dz from bills_d0 and switched to bills_dz
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1                    //Reset Last commit

git reset --hard                              //go to last thing (remove uncommited changes) if this error happened (feature/genericfield_dz|MERGING)
$ git fetch                                    //git all Branches from git lab to local
git branch -m hotfix/AMLUnspicifiedEntityType   //Rename of Branch to hotfix/AMLUnspicifiedEntityType(Change name)
git push origin hotfix/AMLUnspicifiedEntityType // push this Branch as "hotfix/AMLUnspicifiedEntityType"
git status                                //Check Status Of Branch
git branch -D  BranchName                     //  delete BranchName locally
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName    // delete branch remoteBranchName  remotely   (Must Delete Branch Remotlly First Than Locally)
git merge --abort  "Stoped Branch"          //used to Cancel Merge 
git reset commithere(Numer of Commit you want to stop in)      //Wil remove all commits after this commit
git branch -D dev        delete dev locally when you stoped on other branch(must be stoped on other branch)
git checkout -b dev origin/dev          to create branch  dev locally from  origin/dev
git switch -c main                     // this  create branch with the same name of main and the Same configuration if you stop on the same branch
git checkout -b dev origin/dev          //create new branch dev from origin/dev  regardless you stop on any other branch

Use 1: $ git gc --prune=now
    2: $ git remote prune origin

git stash save "prtcustomer changes"      //Must be stoping on your branch if you need stach you will app unsatge

git checkout -b hotfix/transactionlocationslist origin/staging  //Create new Branch Of Staging
==============================
How To make rebase(we need rebase if you take branch than other people take branche and they finshed before you and merged thier changes then your branch not contain thier changes, so you need to make rebase to take thier chages first  and after that your change will be set)
1-git checkout staging   
2-git pull origin staging  
3-git checkout yourbranch 
4-git pull origin yourbranch 
5-git rebase staging (get all change from staging first then take change of your change)  
6-git rebase --continue
================================
to collect your Commit in one Commit Please run those commands
1- git reset 14568b86                                        //14568b86  commite id before any commit you do
  **Allchanges will revert back to visual stadio you can add delete update any thing and commit only from Visual staduio
2-git push -f origin feature/datacleasing_HoldOnbording      //Force Push to Your Branch
